# Hotel Bookings Case Study

## About the project

This [case study](https://github.com/annamandoki/hotel_bookings_case_study/blob/main/hotel_bookings_case_study.md) was inspired by a series of exercises related to the 'hotel_bookings' dataset I worked through while I was doing the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate course. The dataset contains booking information a city hotel and a resort hotel. My goal with this project was to dive deeper into the data and build a case study.

## Business Objective

* Perform different data cleaning tasks
* Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the dataset in order to identify hotel booking trends to help shape the company's marketing strategy towards a set of goals.

## Method

Analyze a public dataset that contains information on hotel bookings due to arrive through a roughly two-year period, including bookings that effectively arrived and bookings that were cancelled.

## Deliverables

1. Summary of the business task
2. Description of the data source, including information on credibility and bias
3. Documentation of data cleaning and transformation
4. Exploratory Data Analysis with supporting visualizations
5. Summary of the analysis and key takeaways
6. Top recommendations for the company based on the analysis
7. [Presentation](https://github.com/annamandoki/hotel_bookings_case_study/blob/main/Presentation_Hotel%20_Bookings%20_Early_Bookings.pdf) on early bookings
