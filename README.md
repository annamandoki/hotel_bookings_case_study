# Hotel Bookings Case Study

This case study was inspired by a series of exercises related to the ‘hotel_bookings’ dataset I worked through while I was doing the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate course. The dataset contains booking information for a city hotel and a resort hotel.

I am going to perform different data cleaning tasks and conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the dataset to identify trends in hotel bookings to help shape the future marketing strategy of the company.
